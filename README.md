# Introduction 
My name is Rex Hygate founder of DeFiSafety. I have almost four years of analyzing DeFi documentation full time and in the last six months I've been looking particularly at stable coin documentation. My project is an analysis and set of recommendations for the website documentation.
# Documentation for DeFi
Documentation should be considered more important by DeFi.  More resources should be placed on communication via the website.
DeFi is in trouble right now.  We're not on boarding new users.  Most DeFi money presently in the system is from experienced DeFi users. Your documentation is targeted towards these existing users not towards new users. This is clear from the diction you use and the topics that are at the top of your documents.
Saying “GHO is the only decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the AAVE protocol” Is a sentence only comprehensible to an experienced DeFi user. Is this what you want?
Consider your audiences in documentation. The documentation should say different things if you were talking to traditional finance people rather than retail users. Consider having different pages on your site speaking to each of your audiences.  
Have a set of pages dedicated to retail users. Have a set of pages dedicated to traditional finance users.  And yes, some pages for degens too.
If the lawyers are limiting what you can say in a significant manner, then this is a serious issue to be addressed internally. Communication is vital and your website is the primary voice you have.
